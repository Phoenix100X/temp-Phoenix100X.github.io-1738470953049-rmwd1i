# Security Guidelines

## Authentication System

### Implementation Details
- Token-based authentication using Supabase Auth
- Secure session management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Protected route middleware
- Profile-based permissions

### Security Measures
- Automatic session expiration
- Secure token storage
- CSRF protection
- XSS prevention
- Rate limiting

### Access Control
- Role hierarchy:
  - Super User (platform admin)
  - Admin
  - Staff
  - Parent
- Route protection based on roles
- Resource-level permissions
- Data isolation between clients

### Best Practices
- Regular session rotation
- Secure password requirements
- Failed login attempt tracking
- Audit logging
- Security headers

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- In-transit encryption (TLS 1.3)
- At-rest encryption (AES-256)
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data

### Access Control
- Row Level Security (RLS)
- Multi-factor authentication
- Session management
- IP whitelisting

### Compliance
- GDPR compliance
- HIPAA compliance
- PCI DSS compliance
- SOC 2 certification

## Best Practices

### Password Security
- Minimum 12 characters
- Special character requirement
- Regular rotation
- Password history

### Data Handling
- Data minimization
- Regular audits
- Secure deletion
- Access logging

### Incident Response
- Security incident reporting
- Response procedures
- Recovery plans
- Communication protocols

## Authentication Flow

1. User attempts to access protected route
2. AuthMiddleware checks authentication status
3. If not authenticated, redirect to login
4. After successful login:
   - Session token stored securely
   - User profile loaded
   - Role-based permissions applied
   - Access granted to authorized routes

## Protected Routes
- /parent/* (Parent access)
- /facility/* (Staff/Admin access)
- /admin/* (Admin access)
- /platform/* (Super User access)

Public routes:
- /login
- /register
- /reset-password

## Security Headers
```typescript
// Security headers automatically applied by Supabase
{
  "X-Frame-Options": "DENY",
  "X-XSS-Protection": "1; mode=block",
  "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
  "Referrer-Policy": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin",
  "Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self'"
}
```

## Regular Security Tasks
1. Audit user permissions
2. Review access logs
3. Update security patches
4. Test incident response
5. Review security policies
